The random forest must include the argument `random_state=42`, and it is useful to also include `n_jobs=-1` (you can use `n_job=-1` throughout this homework wherever it is avaliable). Use 3-fold time series CV split, with the test set split 50% into a validation set and 50% into the actual test set, to tune the hyperparameters `n_estimators` taking the values  200, 400, 600, and the cost-complexity pruning parameter $\\alpha$ taking the values $10^{-k}$, $k=1,3,5,7$. When tuning hyperparameters on the validation sets, fit the model only on a random 10% sample of the instances of the training set on the same CV fold to reduce computational time (that is, use the same reduced training set for all the hyperparameters, but a different one for each CV fold). Note this will still preserve the correct time ordering, and the reduce training set should not be used when fitting and evaluating the best model on the test set. The performance measure is RMSE.
